2.Draw all the nonisomorphic DAGs with two, three, four, and five vertices ?
 DAGs with two vertices:

	1--------->2
 DAGs with three vertices:
                  1--------->2------->3
                  1-------->2<--------3
DAGs with four vertices:
	 1--------->2
	 	 |

		\/
	3--------->	4
	
 	 1--------->2
	 |
